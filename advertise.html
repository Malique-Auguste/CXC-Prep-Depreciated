            <h2>FAQs</h2>

            <h3>Why are our prices so low?</h3>
            <p>The market dictates that we charge one-tenth of our daily visitor count per ad for our basic plan. Therefore given the average of 450+ people visiting our website we should be charging at least 45USD monthly. However, we charge <span class="highlight">only $15</span>.</p>
            <p>Given the high-quality of the plans one may assume that there is a 'catch' because the prices are so cheap. There is none. Insead the reason for these low prices is that CXC Prep's main goal is to make quality education available for free around the Caribbean. Thus <span class="highlight">we offer a bargain</span> to advertisers because we only need enough revenue to meet the overhead costs of operating such a website.</p>

            <h3>What is the target audience?</h3>
            <p>The main audience of CXC Prep is CAPE students between the ages of 15 and 18 years old that attend forms 4 to 6 in Jamaica, Trinidad and Tobago and other Caribbean nations.</p>
       
            <h3>What is the emailing list?</h3>
            <p>With the Premium Plan you gain the ability to connect with over 1000 prospective customers in an email without having to do any of the tedious grunt work of collecting email addresses. These emails are sent out monthly to users and all that you have to do is submit a 75 word advertisement about your product/resource.</p>
        
            <h3>What is the pop-up?</h3>
            <p>With the Premium and Advanced Plan a pop-up is created that displays during at most 3 different sessions for each user (or until they click the link to your resource). A session refers to the period of time that a user spends on the site. For example if a user were to visit CXC Prep both today and tomorrow, it is counted as 2 separate sessions. This pop up will include <span class="highlight">an entire 50 word advertisement</span>, that you have the freedom to write, and can include an appropriate picture of your choosing.</p>
        
            <h3>What is the external-resources section?</h3>
            <p>By purchasing any of the 3 plans, your product/resource will be added to the external resources section of CXC Prep on the home page and on one appropriate subject webpage of your choosing. To further explain, if you are advertising a Pure Mathematics Text Book it will be eligible to be placed on the <a href="cape/pure-maths.html">CAPE Pure Mathematics</a> and <a href="cape/physics.html">CAPE Physics</a> pages amongst others, but won't be placed on the <a href="csec/spanish.html">CSEC Spanish</a> webpage. </p>
